# DadJokes
This is a take home assignment I did for Wiivv as a part of their selection process.

# How to test/debug
Clone/Download and open .xcodeproj file in Xcode

# Workflow
1. Landing page loads a random dad joke
2. Keep tapping 'next' for an endless supply of dad jokes
3. If you have something particular in mind then tap on search and search for it. e.g. search for 'elephant' if you want to hear elephant jokes
4. Upon tapping search you can browse through the search results by tapping 'next'
5. Navigate back to exit search results and to browse random jokes again
